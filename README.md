# Calcit (Simple Calculator)

A heavily optimized, stripped-down version of the original Fossify Calculator, designed for speed, simplicity, and minimal footprint.

**Significant Changes:**

*   **Reduced Size:** APK size significantly reduced by removing widgets, customization engines, unused resources, and language localizations (English only).
*   **Performance:** Faster animations (150ms) and logging completely disabled in release builds for a smoother experience.
*   **Static Theme:** A permanent, high-contrast "Pitch Black" theme.
    *   Background: Pitch Black
    *   Number Buttons: Dark Grey with White Text
    *   Operator Buttons: White with Black Text
    *   Clear Buttons: White with Red Text
    *   Circular buttons with custom ripple animations.
*   **Simplified UI:** Removed "About", "Settings" (color customization), and "Widget" configuration screens.
*   **Privacy:** Full offline functionality preserved.
